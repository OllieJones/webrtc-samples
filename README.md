# WebRTC code samples

This is a repository for the WebRTC JavaScript code samples, forked from [webrtc/samples](https://gitlab.com/webrtc/samples). All of the samples can be tested from [olliejones.github.io/webrtc-samples](https://olliejones.github.io/webrtc-samples).

We welcome contributions and bugfixes. Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/olliejones/webrtc-samples/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## Testing

Some of the samples have an associated test. These are currently using [Nightwatch.JS](https://nightwatchjs.org) and
are only testing the UI of the samples. The purpose of these is to provide examples of how you can write UI tests for
your WebRTC web application.

## Bugs

If you encounter a bug or problem with one of the samples contact olliejones@glance.net.
